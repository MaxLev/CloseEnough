Title: Analyze trajectories within a cellular context

Author: Maxence Le Vasseur

Description: This package uses two-dimensional particle trajectories to identify 
    non-random association and putative interaction between cellular structures. 
    It calculates the nearest distance between each point of a trajectory and 
    surrounding structures reprensented as thresholded binary images taken from a 
    corresponding sequence of reference images. It can also be used to randomize
    the trajectories within a pre-defined area. Randomization is used to determine
    whether the position of particles relative to other cellular structures is
    stochastic.
